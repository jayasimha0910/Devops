	‚Ä¢	useradd: The command to add a new user.
	‚Ä¢	--system:
Creates a system account, which:

	‚Ä¢	Is not intended for interactive login.

	‚Ä¢	--shell /sbin/nologin:

	‚Ä¢	This user cannot log in interactively (e.g., via SSH or terminal).
	‚Ä¢	This is a common practice for service users.
	‚Ä¢	--comment "expense user":
Adds a description (GECOS field) for the user ‚Äî helpful for documentation or admin clarity.
	‚Ä¢	expense:

üß† Practical Use:

This command is typically used in system setup scripts or service deployment where you need a dedicated user account to run a background service or app, like an ‚ÄúExpense Manager‚Äù app.

The user:
	‚Ä¢	Cannot log in interactively (improves security).
	‚Ä¢	Has a defined home directory (/app) where the app might live.
	‚Ä¢	Is isolated, which helps in managing permissions securely.
