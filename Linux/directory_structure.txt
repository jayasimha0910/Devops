"/" 
======
- '/' is the root directory. 
- Every other directory is part of '/'

/bin
======
- The /bin directory in Linux stands for "binary" and contains essential command-line programs (executables) that are required for basic system functionality, especially during boot or recovery. Example: ls, cp, rm, mkdir, etc.

/dev
=======
- The /dev directory in Linux is a special directory that contains device files, also called device nodes. 
- These files are interfaces to hardware devices, allowing programs and users to interact with devices using standard file operations like read/write.
- Linux treats everything as a file, including hardware devices.
- The files in /dev are not regular files; they are special device files created and managed by the kernel or the udev device manager.

/boot
=======
- The /boot directory contains all the files needed to boot the Linux operating system. 
- These files are used very early in the startup process, even before the main filesystem is mounted.

/etc
======
- The /etc directory in Linux contains system-wide configuration files and directories. 
- These files control the behavior of the system, services, and installed applications. 
- For example:
  - /etc/passwd
  - /etc/group
  - /etc/systemd/system

/home
======
- The /home directory is where all regular users’ personal files and settings are stored. 
- Each user gets a subdirectory inside /home, named after their username

/lib
======
- The /lib directory contains essential shared libraries needed by the core system binaries in /bin and /sbin.

/media
========
- The /media directory is used to automatically mount external storage devices such as:
  - USB drives
  - CD/DVDs
  - SD cards
  - External hard drives
- This media is mostly for desktop auto mount environments. It is like plug and play as we see in windows.

/mnt
=====
- The /mnt directory is a standard mount point used for temporarily mounting filesystems, such as:
  - External hard drives
  - USB drives (manually mounted)
  - Network filesystems (NFS, SMB)
  - ISO images
- It’s primarily intended for manual or admin use.
- Manual Mounts Used by system administrators to mount filesystems temporarily No Auto-mounting Unlike /media, this is not used by desktop auto-mount tools Testing or recovery Often used during system recovery or file system testing.

/opt
======
- The /opt directory stands for “optional” and is used to install third-party software that is not part of the default Linux distribution.

/proc
=======
- The /proc directory is a virtual filesystem (not a real one on disk) that provides a real-time interface to kernel and process information.

/root
======
- The /root directory is the home directory for the root user, who is the superuser (administrator) on a Linux system.

/run
======
- The /run directory is a temporary filesystem used to store runtime data for processes and services after boot, such as:
  - Process ID (PID) files
  - Lock files
  - Socket files

/sbin
========
- The /sbin directory contains essential system binaries that are primarily intended for the system administrator (root). 
- These binaries are crucial for system boot, repair, and maintenance.
- Example: fsck, iptables, reboot, iptables, init, etc.

/srv
=======
- The /srv directory stands for "service" and is used to store data served by system services such as:
  - Web servers (httpd, nginx)
  - FTP servers
  - File sharing services

/swap
========
- In Linux, /swap is not a directory, but rather a swap space used as virtual memory to help manage the system's memory resources.
- Swap space can be located either in a swap partition (a dedicated disk partition) or a swap file (a file on the filesystem).
- It allows the system to offload less frequently used memory pages when the physical RAM is full.

/tmp
======
- The /tmp directory is used for temporary file storage. 
- It's a standard location where programs and users can store temporary files that are required only for short-term use.

/usr
======
- The /usr directory is one of the core system directories in Linux.
- It contains user-related programs and data that are not required for the basic system to run, but are essential for most applications.
