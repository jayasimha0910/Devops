awk:
=========
- Used for pattern scanning and processing. 
- It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then perform the associated actions
> Syntax:
        awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file

> Eg:
- echo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-84s/notes/refs/heads/main/session-02.txt | awk -F "/" '{print $1F}'
  - It prints "https:"
- ps -ef | grep mac | awk -F " " '{print $2}’ 
  - This command prints the process id’s which has keyword of Mac. Since P.ID’s are present in 2 column, so I have given 2.

cut:
