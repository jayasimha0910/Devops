## Comparison of `$*` and `$@`
If we pass quoted command-line arguments like “Journey to” “the cloud” to `$*` and `$@`, we get:
- Script:
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in $*; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in $@; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
- Output:
```
./dollarStar.sh "Journey to" "the cloud"
Journey 
to 
the 
cloud
```
If we pass quoted command-line arguments like “Journey to” “the cloud” to `"$*"` and `"$@"`, we get:
- Script:
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in "$*"; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in $@; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
- Output to `"$*"`:
```
./dollarStarQuoted.sh "Journey to" "the cloud"
Journey to the cloud
```
- Output to `"$@"`:
```
./dollarAtQuoted.sh "Journey to" "the cloud"
Journey to
the cloud
```

## Conclusion
- In this article, we explored the similarities and differences between `$*` and `$@` and their quoted variants. 
- They behave the same way when not quoted: 
- They treat each argument as a separate entity and preserve spaces and special characters within individual arguments. 
- However, their behavior is different if we quote them. 
- While `“$@”` keeps individual arguments, `“$*”` treats them as a single entity.
