## Comparison of `$*` and `$@`
If we pass quoted command-line arguments like “Journey to” “the cloud” to `$*` and `$@`, we get the same results as before:
- Script:
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in $*; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
```
!/bin/bash
for arg in $@; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```
- Output:
```
./dollarStar.sh "Journey to" "the cloud"
Journey 
to 
the 
cloud
```
