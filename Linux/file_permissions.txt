Permissions for the files
=========================

7 is a magic number: "4+2+1=7”
-> 4 —> Read - r
-> 2 —> Write - w
-> 1 —> Execute - x

| Number | Octal Permission Representation                                              | Ref  |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| 0      | No permission                                                                | ---  |
| 1      | Execute permission                                                           | --x  |
| 2      | Write permission                                                             | -w-  |
| 3      | Execute and write permission: 1 (execute) + 2 (write) = 3                    | -wx  |
| 4      | Read permission                                                              | r--  |
| 5      | Read and execute permission: 4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5                      | r-x  |
| 6      | Read and write permission: 4 (read) + 2 (write) = 6                          | rw-  |
| 7      | All permissions: 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7                      | rwx  |


Types of files
==============
In Linux, when you run ls -l, the first character in the permissions string indicates the type of file:

| Symbol | Meaning                    |
|--------|----------------------------|
| -      | Regular file *(Important)* |
| d      | Directory *(Important)*    |
| l      | Symbolic link              |
| c      | Character device           |
| b      | Block device               |
| s      | Socket                     |
| p      | Named pipe (FIFO)          |

Example:
—————---
-> -rwxr-xr-x  → Regular file with rwx for user, r-x for group, r-x for others
-> drwxr-x---  → Directory with rwx for user, r-x for group, --- for others
-> lrwxrwxrwx  → Symbolic link with full permissions (not enforced)

| Entry       | File Type      | Permissions (User / Group / Others)                         |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| -rw-r--r--  | - = Regular File | User: read/write, Group: read, Others: read               |
| drwxr-xr-x  | d = Directory    | User: all, Group: read/execute, Others: read/execute      |
