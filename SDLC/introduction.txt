Software Development Life Cycle:
================================
> Structured process used for developing software efficiently and with high quality. 
> It outlines the steps involved from the initial idea or need for software to its final deployment and maintenance.

01. Requirement Analysis
02. Planning
03. Designing -> General requirements into Technical Requirements
04. Implementation — (Development)
05. Testing
06. Deployment
07. Maintenance

Key Phases of SDLC:
--------------------
	1.	Planning
	•	Define the goals, scope, and purpose of the software.
	•	Identify resources, timelines, costs, and potential risks.
	2.	Requirement Analysis
	•	Gather and analyze the business/user requirements.
	•	Create a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
	3.	Design
	•	Translate requirements into a blueprint for building the software.
	•	Includes UI/UX design, system architecture, and database design.
	4.	Implementation (or Development)
	•	Developers write code based on the design.
	•	This is the actual creation of the software.
	5.	Testing
	•	The software is tested to identify and fix bugs.
	•	Ensures the product meets requirements and works as expected.
	6.	Deployment
	•	Software is released for use in the real environment.
	•	Can be a phased rollout or full deployment.
	7.	Maintenance
	•	Continuous support, updates, and bug fixes.
	•	Improves performance or adds new features over time.
