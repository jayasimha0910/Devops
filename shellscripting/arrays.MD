## Arrays
- If we want to represent a group of values with a single name then we should go for arrays concept.

## How to Create Arrays:
If we know elements at the beginning:
```
courses=(Java Python Linux Django)
```
If we don't know elements at the biginning:
```
courses[0]=Java 
courses[1]=Python 
courses[2]=Linux 
courses[3]=Django
```
The index values need not be consecutive.We can take randomly.
```
courses[10]=DataScience 
courses[20]=Devops
```
